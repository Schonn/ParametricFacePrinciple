# ParametricFacePrinciple
A Blender python script for generating a face mesh with UI calls and controlling the transformation of face features using variables.
To use this script, you may copy the contents of the script into the Blender text editor. The parameter variables start on line 114 of the script. Each time you run the script, a face will be generated from scratch or will replace the currently selected object. In this way, you can adjust the values of the variables and run the script with the previous face selected to 'update' it.
